              I'm a passionate Developer, proficient in the MERN stack, with
              strong problem-solving skills, team management experience, and an
              eagerness to learn and adapt to new technologies.

            <li>
              My journey into web development began during my college days,
              where I built a crowdsourced city improvement platform. That
              project sparked my interest in creating transparent and impactful
              applications.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              As I grow and flourish as a Developer, I am driven by my curiosity
              to explore new advancements, like generative AI and teachable
              machine models.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              Fast-forward to today, I have built a number of responsive web
              applications, led teams in construct weeks, and completed rigorous
              training in the MERN stack. With my knowledge of React,
              JavaScript, and practical experience in startups, I am now seeking
              a role as a frontend developer to contribute to innovative
              solutions.
